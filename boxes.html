			This exercise is meant to help us practice using id selectors and get used to how the div tags works. We will take a look at nested divs, since they are the basis for all CSS layout.
    </div>
    <div id="box1">
      This is the first box
    </div>
    <div id="box2">
      This is the second box.
    </div>
    <div id="box3">
      This is the third box. It has the float left property
      <div id="box4">
        This is the fourth box and it is inside the third box because these dives are nested
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="box5">
      This is the fifth box and by using the float left property it is floating left next to the third box.
    </div>
    <div id="box6">
      This is the sixth box and it is floating left. It floats left directly next to the fifth box if there is enough room.
    </div>
    <div id="box7">
      This is the seventh box and it is floating right.
    </div>
